# fuguV5
A generative chatbot using various GPT models.

I currently don't have the resources to work on this project (unfortunately).

This has to wait until summer.


To use:

Download any GPT model by using the download_model.py file.
Make sure you have the dependencies for GPT2.

Fugu5 is the most recent model. Fugu2 is included as it has features not remade in Fugu5 (like VADER NLP based sentiment analysis) for performance reasons.
